This second little PICO-8 game was created for the Mini Jam 84: Bubbles.

## About the game:

In this game you play the heart that is kept alive in the sea by an oxygen bubble. To survive you have to collect oxygen. Watch out: dangers lurk in the water like dangerous poisons and bombs. Avoid or destroy them with the help of your oxygen, which can serve as ammunition!

During the entire duration of the game, your freedom of movement is restricted by a single accessible area in the water. Will you survive?

Unlockable achievements are integrated in the game for even longer fun in the game.
